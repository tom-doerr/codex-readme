# codex-readme
## What is it?

This project is a set of programs that I use to create a README.md file.

## How does it work?

It reads program files and concatenates the beginning of all files to create a input prompt which is then fed to OpenAI Codex to generate a README.

## How to use it?

```
./codex_readme.py
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add more programs and improve the README.md generator.

## License
